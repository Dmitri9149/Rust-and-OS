I learn how to develop an operating system in Rust, Following the [series of blogs](https://os.phil-opp.com/).     
The Rust 2021 edition is used ( not 2018 edition as in the blog series). 

The branch ```a_freestanding_rust_binary_finished``` correspond to the 
https://os.phil-opp.com/freestanding-rust-binary/ chapter.
